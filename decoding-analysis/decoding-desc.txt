  PROJECT: CUE-INVARIANT GEOMETRIC STRUCTURE OF POPULATION CODES
=====================================================


PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
This project investigates the geometric structure of population codes in response to different visual cues. The analysis uses a Procrustes-based transfer decoding method to compare these structures across three main domains:
1. Real neuronal recordings from macaque visual cortex (V1 & V2).
2. Activations from Deep Neural Networks (AlexNet & VGG).
3. Responses from computational Gabor filter models.


FOLDER STRUCTURE
----------------
The project is organized into three primary analysis directories, each corresponding to one of the domains mentioned above. A fourth directory contains scripts for a specific PCA-based visualization.

* `neuronal_decoding/`: Contains all data, code, and results related to the macaque neural recordings (monkeys FR and KO).
* `ANN_decoding/`: Contains all data, code, and results for the analyses on AlexNet and VGG.
* `Gabor_decoding/`: Contains all data, code, and results for the Gabor filter models (simple and complex).
* `PT PCA sactter visualization/`: Contains scripts and assets for creating scatter plots of the neural data in a shared PCA space with stimulus image overlays.


COMMON SUBDIRECTORY LAYOUT
--------------------------
Each of the three main analysis directories (`neuronal_decoding`, `ANN_decoding`, `Gabor_decoding`) follows a consistent internal structure:

    * `/*_data/`: (e.g., `neuronal_data/`, `ANN_response_data/`)
        This folder holds the input data for the analyses.

    * `/code/`: This folder contains all MATLAB scripts.
        * `/decoding_scripts/`: Scripts that perform the data processing and decoding.
        * `/visualization_scripts/`: Scripts that generate figures from the results.

    * `/results/`: This folder stores the outputs generated by the scripts.
        * `/decoding_outputs/`: Raw numerical results (`.mat` files).
        * `/figures/`: Final plots and figures (`.png`, `.fig`).


ANALYSIS WORKFLOW
-----------------
The general workflow for this project is a three-step process:

1.  *Prepare Data*:
    For the ANN and Gabor models, first run the appropriate `generate_*_data.m` script to create the synthetic trial data from the raw responses.

2.  *Run Decoding*:
    Execute the desired script from a `/decoding_scripts/` folder (e.g., `procrustes_decoding_basic.m`). This will process the data and save numerical results to the `/results/decoding_outputs/` directory.

3.  *Visualize Results*:
    Finally, run the corresponding script from a `/visualization_scripts/` folder to load the results and generate the final plots, which are saved in the `/results/figures/` directory.
